## Overview of the analysis

While on vacation in Hawaii last year you discovered a newfound passion for surfing. You've been trying to come up with a plan that will let you not just return to Hawaii but live there forever. You finally come up with an idea that you think is foolproof. A Surf n' Shake shop serving surfboards and ice cream to locals, tourists, and of course yourself.You have some savings vou're willing to invest, but we'll need some real investor backing to get this off the ground. So after putting together a strong business plan you reach out to an investor W. Avy who is famous for his love of surfing. Your first meeting with him goes extremely well but he has one concern. What about the weather? He's extremely serious about this. He invested in a surf shop early in his career,However, he didn't ask for any weather analysis and that early venture was rained out of existence. W. Avy knows you've been learning how to properly analyze data and asks if you can run some analytics on a weather dataset he has from the very island where you'd like to open your shop: The beautiful Oahu. And so, Aloha, Let's go!

The frequency of temperatures recorded in June tends to have a much more normal, tight bell curve distribution, cooroborated by the smaller std measure of June temps vs December temps. When we looking at the plotted distribution of Dec Temps, we can see that the median temperature in Dec is more inline with the average, and there are not many outliers skuing the average temperature higher or lower than the actual recorded frequency.

Based on the information, and globalc warming, tbe temperature is climbing up with more hight tempereature days year aroud. We also have to consider that Hawaii is a tourist place. Opening an ice cream store is totally a good idea.
